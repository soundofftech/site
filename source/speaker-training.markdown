# Speaker Training


Led by our own Jeff Watkins, these lessons focus on using body language, gestures, and your voice to enhance your story telling. The class breaks into two sessions held over consecutive days to allow for sufficient class participation. We won't turn anyone away, but do give first preference to under represented groups.

If youâ€™d like to participate, please feel free to email [speakertraining@soundofftech.org](mailto:speakertraining@soundofftech.org) for more info.
