UIKonf is Berlin's independent conference for serious iOS developers. Taking place from May 22nd - 25th 2016 in the cosy atmosphere of Heimathafen Neuk√∂lln it is a great place to meet and connect with experienced developers from all over Europe.

UIKonf features inspiring speakers giving talks on cutting edge topics in iOS development, mobile design and business.

This year, we'll be providing live captioning to ensure attendees with hearing impairments and attendees for whom English is not their primary language also have the opportunity to enjoy UIKonf as much as everyone else.
