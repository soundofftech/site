This month, we’re raising money to send two fellows or alumni of [CODE2040][code2040] to [Layers 2016][layers]!

Layers is a design conference in San Francisco taking place from June 13th - June 15th. Folks who know our [history][history], know that Sound Off started as an informal fundraiser to send two women on scholarship to Layers 2015. We’re proud to continue to support a conference that features some of the best and brightest voices in our industry, including an outstanding number of women and people of color on stage and in the audience. Like all the conferences we support, Layers has a strong Code of Conduct.

CODE2040 is a nonprofit organization that creates pathways to educational, professional, and entrepreneurial success in technology for underrepresented minorities with a specific focus on Blacks and Latin[x][x]s. Every summer, CODE2040’s flagship Fellows Program supports minority students interning in Silicon Valley by providing them with a sense of community, through mentorship, a speaker series, and workshops. CODE2040’s mission aligns with our own, and we’re excited to partner with them to increase opportunities for their fellows and alumni.

Partnering Layers with CODE2040 fellows and alumni gives these up-and-coming technologists a chance to learn from industry veterans and to interact with them as peers. These interactions will have a positive impact on everyone involved, fostering opportunities for networking and mentorship.
