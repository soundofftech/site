call_to_action: Help provide live captioning for deaf and hard of hearing attendees at Open Source & Feelings 2016.

This month, we’re raising money to live caption [Open Source & Feelings 2016][osf]!

Open Source & Feelings has a thorough and unambiguous [code of conduct][coc], one of the best [diversity statements][div] we’ve seen from a conference, and an [about][about] page with everything from venue accessibility, to public transit, to tips about keeping safe while traveling to and from the conference. Everything about Open Source & Feelings communicates thoughtfulness, deliberateness, and listening to feedback.

The conference, hosted in Seattle, takes place on July 22nd & July 23rd. We’re happy to be helping them open up their event to the deaf and hard of hearing communities, as well as the many hearing attendees who [benefit][ashleyblog] from live captioning.
