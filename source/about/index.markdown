# What We Do

Sound Off works to increase access to professional settings for marginalized peoples in tech. Our current focus is on access to conferences.

So far we've worked on 5 main topics:

* Attendance scholarships
* Cost of travel and lodging for speakers
* Live captioning
* ASL interpreters
* Child day care

We're always looking for new topics to work on!

# How We Work

Sound Off coordinates with blogs and podcasts to raise awareness around our current campaign. Once a month, we ask participants to post or speak about the current campaign and provide a url where people can get more info and make a donation.

We're setup this way to make it easy for people to give directly to the causes we promote. We're in the process of setting up a 501c3 for people who want to have their donations matched or for organizations that don't want to organize their own fundraising, but we want to emphasize any giving to our operating costs will be clearly demarcated and optional.
