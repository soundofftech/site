# Some History

Sound Off started quietly enough. In May of 2015, former Seattle Xcoder and all-around excellent person, Jessie Char announced a new conference, [Layers](http://www.bringyourlayers.com). In a nod to the unequal pay women **still** receive, Layers offered discounted tickets to attendees who identified as women. This moved a few of us in the Seattle Xcoders community to raise the money to provide two scholarship tickets. Subscriptions opened with a simple email among friends:

> I've contacted Jessie Char about offering a scholarship for a woman designer/engineer for her upcoming Layers conference (http://www.bringyourlayers.com) funded by the Seattle community. I think between us, this would be relatively painless. 
>
> The ticket costs $850.
>
> I'll start by covering $100. That leaves us with $750.
>
> Who's going to help me make this happen?

In less than a day, just a few people contributed money sufficient to send two women to the conference.

In the following months, we provided American Sign Language interpreters and live captioning to [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com) in Detroit. One of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about supporting ASL interpreters and live captioning is their presence at a conference can be the factor that hearing impaired conference goers use to decide whether to attend or not. It may be possible to read lips face to face, but a speaker on stage is too distant. An additional benefit of live captioning is conferences become substantially more accessible to conference goers for whom English may not be their primary or strongest language.

Then in October, we provided another pair of scholarship tickets for two women to attend [NSScotland](http://nsscotland.com). One of our founders would be speaking there and we wanted to do our part to help enable underrepresented people to attend. We were also intrumental in encouraging their first childcare program, which was a smashing success. The children of the conference attendees made a movie about super powered squirrels. 

This habit had to be encouraged.

# Looking Ahead

In January of 2016, we launched the Sound Off website with our first fundraising effort to once again provide ASL interpreters and live captioning for AlterConf. Our plan is to run a monthly fundraiser for a conference or organisation we feel is deserving of attention.
