I want to take a moment to thank everyone who's made our fundraising effort to provide live captioning for UIKonf in May such a resounding success so far. We crushed our goal last night: $1,500 raised in only 7 days. That's outstanding. We definitely couldn't do it without the help of some really great people.

One of the outstanding things about using GoFundMe this time is seeing the names of the people who have been helping us reach our goal. There are the usual suspects: people I know or know of. Thank you so much. But what amazes me are all the people I don't know who are willing to help make UIKonf more accessible for attendees who might be hard of hearing or who might not speak English as their first (or second) language. For example, I asked Ashley and Doug, "Who's Anders Borum?" and the response was "A quality human I do not know, but should".  We can't properly thank all the anonymous donors, but we wouldn't have made our goal without you. Thanks so much!

If you've blogged about the fund raiser, please let me know (my DMs are open). If you've tweeted about it, I'm happy to retweet you, just DM me the link. We appreciate all your help.

Based on our progress so far, we'd like to set a goal of reaching $2,000 by next Tuesday. With your help, we're confident that shouldn't be too great a challenge.
