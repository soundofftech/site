We're in the final stretch of our campaign to raise $3,000 to provide live captioning for UIKonf. On Thursday, we set a [goal of raising $2,000 by today](/blog/2016/04/halfway-to-uikonf). Frankly, I thought that was a bit ambitious, but once again your generosity has astonished me. We actually hit our goal Sunday evening!

Since our last milestone, we've had donations from some wonderful people including a [tea engineer](https://twitter.com/ayanonagon), a [purple fancier](https://twitter.com/purpleyay), a [hedgie aficionado](https://twitter.com/catehstn), and an [accessibility advocate](https://twitter.com/cordeliadillon). If you're not following these women on Twitter already, you're missing out.

Based on our progress, we think we can wrap this up by next Wednesday. Your support has been amazing so far. Thank you so much! We're looking forward to seeing some of you in Berlin and the rest on the live stream.
