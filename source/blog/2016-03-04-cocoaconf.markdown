Our own Jeff Watkins on CocoaConf and Codes of Conduct

> This brings me back to Cocoa Conf, which doesn’t have a code of conduct. As we began to plan for Yosemite, I emailed Dave and Solomon to see whether we could get them to adopt a code of conduct. We were willing to be pragmatic: something that offered reasonable and specific protections that might be enhanced over time. Regrettably, we weren’t able to make sufficient progress to allow us to support Cocoa Conf Yosemite.
