With your help, [Sound Off Round 2][rd2] successfully raised $3,115 from 51 people in 29 days! This means we’ll be bringing live captioning to [UIKonf][uikonf] this May. Thank you to everyone who donated, tweeted, and told their friends.

We're making the final estimate for live captioning from [White Coat Captioning][whitecoat] available today as a [pdf][estimate]. Once the invoice is paid, we'll update this post to include it.

Astute observers will notice that the published estimate is $375 higher than our goal. We based our fundraising on the first estimate we received. We’ll be leaving the [GoFundMe][gofundme] open until UIKonf for any generous souls to help cover the gap.

We can’t wait to share our next round with you. Be on the lookout for it May 1st!
