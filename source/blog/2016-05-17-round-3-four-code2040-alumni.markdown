With your help, [Sound Off Round 3][round3] successfully raised $3,085 from 31 people in 14 days! This means 4 [CODE2040][code2040] alumni will be attending [Layers 2016][layers]. Thank you to everyone who donated, tweeted, and told their friends.

The alumni will receive their tickets this week and we’ll be posting the paid invoice as soon we receive it.

We can’t wait to share our next round with you. Be on the lookout for it!
