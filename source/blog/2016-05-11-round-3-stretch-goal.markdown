Wow [#teamSoundOff][hashtag], you're all incredible! 

In just 9 days, you've donated enough money to exceed our goal of sending two CODE2040 alumni to Layers 2016.

It’s come to our attention that Layers offers the discount code DIVERSITY for attendees in tech from underrepresented backgrounds. With this code, attendee ticket prices to Layers are $700, instead of $850. Since we’re currently just $265 away from sending **three** CODE2040 alumni to Layers using the discount code, today we’re setting that as our stretch goal. 

We’ll be ending Round 3 this Friday, leaving just three days remaining to fundraise. That said, your support has been so amazing that I’m confident we can hit the stretch goal. As always, any extra funds received over the stretch amount will be rolled over to our next round of fundraising.

Thank you all so much for your generosity, I’ve never been prouder to be a part of this industry.

**[Donate][donate] now to help us send three alumni of CODE2040 to Layers 2016!**
