We're tremendously excited to lead off our first fundraising campaign raising money to provide American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters and live captioning for the 2016 series of AlterConf conferences. Sign language and live captioning benefit not only hearing impaired but attendees for whom English may not be their primary language.

In 2015, we underwrote AlterConf's Detroit conference. This year our goal is to provide a general ASL/live captioning fund to be applied to all of their conferences. In the United States, American Sign Language interpreters and live captioning costs on average $1,500 to $2,000 per event. 

## About AlterConf

AlterConf is a traveling conference series providing safe opportunities for marginalized people and those who support them in the tech and gaming industries. By highlighting the powerful voices and positive initiatives of local community members, they build hope and strengthen the community’s resolve to create safer, healthier spaces for everyone.

The conferences go beyond the limited definitions and basic discussions of diversity to create a deeper, more nuanced conversation. Each conference features a wide range of speakers delivering critical analyses of tech and gaming culture and presenting their vision for what our community can be.
