Round 2 kicks off today, with [UIKonf][uikonf] and live captioning!

UIKonf is an independent conference in Berlin, Germany focusing on iOS development. Like all conferences we work with, UIKonf features a strong [Code of Conduct][uikonf-coc] to set expectations for attendees, speakers, and sponsors. Our own [Jeff Watkins][jeffwatkins] and [Ashley Nelson-Hornstein][ashleynh] will be speaking this year. Be sure to say "hi" if you’re attending!

Live captioning for UIKonf is not only going to open up the conference to the deaf community and the hard of hearing, but will be indispensable for many of the attendees for whom English is not their first language.

Captioning for the two days of talks will cost $3,000. We're lucky to have retained [White Coat Captioning][whitecoat] – the same team that captions [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com) for our friend Ashe Dryden. So we're sure they'll do a great job.

This time around we're trying out Go Fund Me to ease the stress on UIKonf and provide public tracking of our fundraising. We'll pay White Coat Captioning directly and make an invoice available after the event. Should we raise more than our goal of $3000, the additional funds will be rolled over into our next fundraising campaign.
