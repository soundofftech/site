Sound Off is a non-profit (paperwork pending) that works to increase the access marginalized people in tech have to professional opportunities. Each month, Sound Off hosts a round of fundraising to support a worthy cause in technology.

This month, we’re raising money to live caption [Open Source & Feelings 2016][osf]!

Open Source & Feelings has a thorough and unambiguous [code of conduct][coc], one of the best [diversity statements][div] we’ve seen from a conference, and an [about][about] page with everything from venue accessibility, to public transit, to tips about keeping safe while traveling to and from the conference. Everything about Open Source & Feelings communicates thoughtfulness, deliberateness, and listening to feedback.

The conference, hosted in Seattle, takes place on July 22nd & July 23rd. We’re happy to be helping them open up their event to the deaf and hard of hearing communities, as well as the many hearing attendees who [benefit][ashleyblog] from live captioning.

Our fundraising goal for this round is $3300, the cost of live captioning plus payment processing fees. Once again, we’re using YouCaring as our fundraising platform. YouCaring is specifically built for charitable giving and does not charge a percentage fee on the money raised. This means that more of your donated amount will go to the cause. Should we raise more than our goal of $3300, the additional funds will be rolled over into our next fundraising campaign. As always, we’ll make an invoice publicly available after the event.

[Donate][donate] now to help us live caption Open Source & Feelings 2016!
