## Some History

Sound Off started quietly enough. In May of 2015, former Seattle Xcoder and all-around excellent person, Jessie Char announced a new conference, [Layers](http://www.bringyourlayers.com). In a nod to the unequal pay women **still** receive, Layers offered discounted tickets to attendees who identified as women. This moved a few of us in the Seattle Xcoders community to raise the money to provide two scholarship tickets. Subscriptions opened with a simple email among friends:

> I've contacted Jessie Char about offering a scholarship for a woman designer/engineer for her upcoming Layers conference (http://www.bringyourlayers.com) funded by the Seattle community. I think between us, this would be relatively painless. 
>
> The ticket costs $850.
>
> I'll start by covering $100. That leaves us with $750.
>
> Who's going to help me make this happen?

In less than a day, just a few people contributed money sufficient to send two women to the conference.

In the following months, we provided American Sign Language interpreters and live captioning to [AlterConf](http://alterconf.com) in Detroit. One of the reasons we're so enthusiastic about supporting ASL interpreters and live captioning is their presence at a conference can be the factor that hearing impaired conference goers use to decide whether to attend or not. It may be possible to read lips face to face, but a speaker on stage is too distant. An additional benefit of live captioning is conferences become substantially more accessible to conference goers for whom English may not be their primary or strongest language.

Then in October, we provided another pair of scholarship tickets for two women to attend [NSScotland](http://nsscotland.com). One of our founders would be speaking there and we wanted to do our part to help enable under represented people to attend. We were also intrumental in encouraging their first childcare program, which was a smashing success. The children of the conference attendees made a movie about super powered squirrels. 

This habit had to be encouraged.

## Principles
In January of 2016, we launched the Sound Off Web site with our first fund raising effort to once again provide ASL interpreters and live captioning for AlterConf. Our plan is to run a monthly fund raiser for a conference or organisation we feel is deserving of attention.

We don't believe we're qualified to solve the problem of under represented people in the technology industry. That problem is so vast, so much larger than us. But there are great people doing amazing work: they don't get enough attention, they don't get enough money. We hope that by helping them get attention and money, we will be helping them solve the crushing challenges facing our industry.

## Our Board
While Sound Off was founded by two white men – arguably, representatives of all that's wrong with our industry – we've moving quickly to seat a board that is more representative of our goals.

# What We Do

Sound Off works to increase access to professional settings for marginalized peoples in tech. Our current focus is on access to conferences.

So far we've worked on 5 main topics:

* Attendance scholarships
* Cost of travel and lodging for speakers
* Live captioning
* ASL interpreters
* Child day care

We're always looking for new topics to work on!

# How We Work

Sound Off coordinates with blogs and podcasts to raise awareness around our current campaign. Once a month, we ask participants to post or speak about the current campaign and provide a url where people can get more info and make a donation.

We're setup this way to make it easy for people to give directly to the causes we promote. We're in the process of setting up a 501c3 for people who want to have their donations matched or for organizations that don't want to organize their own fundraising, but we want to emphasize any giving to our operating costs will be clearly demarcated and optional.
